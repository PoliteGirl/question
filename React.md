# React.js

### Q : What is React?
A : React is a front-end and open-source JavaScript library which is useful in developing user interfaces specifically for applications with a single page. It is helpful in building complex and reusable user interface(UI) components of mobile and web applications as it follows the component-based approach.

* react simplify the creating of SPA by using reusable components.

* It supports server-side rendering.

* It will make use of the virtual DOM rather than real DOM (Data Object Model) as RealDOM manipulations are expensive.

* It follows unidirectional data binding or data flow : In React, data flows in a single direction, from parent to child. This means that a parent component can pass data to its child components via props, but the child cannot directly modify the data of the parent.

* It uses reusable or composable UI components for developing the view.

* index.html is entry point of react app

### Q : Features of react.
A : 
* Uses JSX syntax, a syntax extension of JS that allows developers to write HTML in their JS code.
* It uses Virtual DOM instead of Real DOM considering that Real DOM manipulations are expensive.
* Supports server-side rendering which is useful for Search Engine Optimizations(SEO).
* Follows Unidirectional or one-way data flow or data binding.
* Uses reusable/composable UI components to develop the view.

### Q : What are the advantages of using React?
A : 
* Increases the application's performance with Virtual DOM.
* JSX makes code easy to read and write.
* It renders both on client and server side (SSR).
* Easy to integrate with frameworks (Angular, Backbone) since it is only a view library.
* Easy to write unit and integration tests with tools such as Jest.

### Q : What is JSX?
A : 
* with help of babel library jsx code gets convert to js code that browser can understand. Babel is a transpiler.

JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows us to write HTML inside JavaScript and place them in the DOM without using functions like appendChild( ) or createElement( ). As stated in the official docs of React, JSX provides syntactic sugar for React.createElement( ) function.

Note- We can create react applications without using JSX as well.

Letâ€™s understand how JSX works:
```
const container = (
<div>
  <p>This is a text</p>
</div>
);
ReactDOM.render(container,rootElement);
```

### Q : What is SyntheticEvent?
A : Certainly! In a simple way:

A SyntheticEvent in React is like a wrapper around real events (like clicks or keystrokes) that happen in a web browser. React uses it to make sure event handling works consistently across different browsers, making it easier for developers to work with events in their React components. It's like a standardized package for handling events, ensuring things work smoothly no matter which browser your app is running in.

### Q : What is Component?
A : In react, a component is reusable building block for creating UI.

### Q : What are the differences between functional and class components?
A : There are mainly two type

Before the introduction of Hooks in React, functional components were called stateless components and were behind class components on a feature basis. After the introduction of Hooks, functional components are equivalent to class components.

Although functional components are the new trend, the react team insists on keeping class components in React. Therefore, it is important to know how these components differ.

* Function Components: This is the simplest way to create a component. Those are pure JavaScript functions that accept props object as the first parameter and return React elements to render the output:
```
function card(props){
   return(
      <div className="main-container">
        <h2>Title of the card</h2>
      </div>
    )
}
//---- OR
const card = (props) =>{
    return(
      <div className="main-container">
        <h2>Title of the card</h2>
      </div>
    )
}
```

* Class Components: You can also use ES6 class to define a component. The above function component can be written as a class component:
```
 class Card extends React.Component{
  constructor(props){
     super(props);
   }
    render(){
      return(
        <div className="main-container">
          <h2>Title of the card</h2>
        </div>
      )
    }
   }
```

### Q : When to use a Class Component over a Function Component?
A : * If the component needs state or lifecycle methods then use class component otherwise use function component. However, from React 16.8 with the addition of Hooks, you could use state , lifecycle methods and other features that were only available in class component right in your function component. 
* So, it is always recommended to use Function components, unless you need a React functionality whose Function component equivalent is not present yet, like Error Boundaries.

### Q : What is the virtual DOM? How does react use the virtual DOM to render the UI?
A : As stated by the react team, virtual DOM is a concept where a virtual representation of the real DOM is kept inside the memory and is synced with the real DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.

The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is an in-memory representation of Real DOM. The representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the "real" DOM. It's a step that happens between the render function being called and the displaying of elements on the screen. This entire process is called reconciliation.

### Q : What is state in React?
A : State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. We should always try to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components.

State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component ,i.e., it is not accessible to any other component till the owner component decides to pass it.

Let's create a user component with message state,
```
class User extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)

    this.state = {
      message: 'Welcome to React world'
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

### Q : What are props in React?
A : Props are inputs to components. They are single values or objects containing a set of values that are passed to components on creation using a naming convention similar to HTML-tag attributes. They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component.

The primary purpose of props in React is to provide following component functionality:

* Pass custom data to your component.
* Trigger state changes.
* Use via this.props.reactProp inside component's render() method.

### Q : What is the difference between state and props?
A : Both props and state are plain JavaScript objects. While both of them hold information that influences the output of render, they are different in their functionality with respect to component. Props get passed to the component similar to function parameters whereas state is managed within the component similar to variables declared within a function.

### Q : Why should we not update the state directly?
A :  you try to update the state directly then it won't re-render the component.

//Wrong
```
this.state.message = 'Hello world'
```
Instead use setState() method. It schedules an update to a component's state object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering.

//Correct
```
this.setState({ message: 'Hello World' })
```
Note: You can directly assign to the state object either in constructor or using latest javascript's class field declaration syntax.

### Q : What is "key" prop and what is the benefit of using it in arrays of elements?
A : A key is a special string attribute you should include when creating arrays of elements. Key prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.

### Q : What are the differences between controlled and uncontrolled components?
A : 
* controlled : 
In a controlled component, the value of the input element is controlled by React. We store the state of the input element inside the code, and by using event-based callbacks, any changes made to the input element will be reflected in the code as well.
When a user enters data inside the input element of a controlled component, onChange function gets triggered and inside the code, we check whether the value entered is valid or invalid. If the value is valid, we change the state and re-render the input element with the new value.
```
handleChange(event) {
  this.setState({value: event.target.value.toUpperCase()})
}
```

* Uncontrolled component: 
In an uncontrolled component, the value of the input element is handled by the DOM itself. Input elements inside uncontrolled components work just like normal HTML input form elements.
The state of the input element is handled by the DOM. Whenever the value of the input element is changed, event-based callbacks are not called. Basically, react does not perform any action when there are changes made to the input element.
```
class UserProfile extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
    this.input = React.createRef();
  }

  handleSubmit(event) {
    alert("A name was submitted: " + this.input.current.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          {"Name:"}
          <input type="text" ref={this.input} />
        </label>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```
Whenever use enters data inside the input field, the updated data is shown directly. To access the value of the input element, we can use ref.

### Q : What are the lifecycle methods of React?
A : 
componentWillMount
componentDidMount
componentWillReceiveProps
shouldComponentUpdate
componentWillUpdate
componentDidUpdate
componentWillUnmount

### Q : What is the purpose of callback function as an argument of setState()?
A : The callback function is invoked when setState finished and the component gets rendered. Since setState() is asynchronous the callback function is used for any post action.

Note: It is recommended to use lifecycle method rather than this callback function.
```
setState({ name: "John" }, () =>
  console.log("The name has updated and component re-rendered")
);
```

### Q : What is "key" prop and what is the benefit of using it in arrays of elements?
A : In React, the `key` prop is a special attribute that should be assigned to elements inside an array to help React identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed. When rendering a list of elements using the `map` function, each rendered element should have a unique `key` prop.

The `key` prop serves two primary purposes:

1. **Optimizing Reconciliation:** React uses the `key` prop to optimize the process of reconciling the virtual DOM with the actual DOM. When an array of elements is updated (e.g., elements are added, removed, or reordered), React can efficiently update only the elements that have changed by comparing their keys.

2. **Preserving Component State:** The `key` prop helps React maintain component state between renders. If the `key` of an element remains the same across renders, React can identify it as the same element, preserving its state. If the `key` changes, React treats it as a different element.

Here's an example of using the `key` prop when rendering a list of elements:

```jsx
const MyList = ({ items }) => {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map(item => (
        <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};

// Example usage:
const items = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Item 1' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' },
  { id: 3, name: 'Item 3' },
];

ReactDOM.render(<MyList items={items} />, document.getElementById('root'));
```
* It's important to note that the `key` should be unique among siblings but doesn't need to be globally unique. React uses the `key` prop to optimize the performance of updates within the same parent component. If the `key` prop is omitted, React may issue a warning, and it's generally good practice to provide a meaningful and stable `key` for each element in a list.

### Q : What are Higher-Order Components?
A : 
A higher-order component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. Basically, it's a pattern that is derived from React's compositional nature.

We call them pure components because they can accept any dynamically provided child component but they won't modify or copy any behavior from their input components.

const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent)
HOC can be used for many use cases:

* Code reuse, logic and bootstrap abstraction.
* Render hijacking.
* State abstraction and manipulation.
* Props manipulation.

### Q : What is reconciliation?
A : When a component's props or state change, React decides whether an actual DOM update is necessary by comparing the newly returned element with the previously rendered one. When they are not equal, React will update the DOM. This process is called reconciliation.

### Q : What are the rules that must be followed while using React Hooks?
A :
* React Hooks must be called only at the top level. It is not allowed to call them inside the nested functions, loops, or conditions.
* It is allowed to call the Hooks only from the React Function Components.

### Q : Name a few techniques to optimize React app performance.
A : Yes, there are several techniques you can employ to improve the performance of React.js applications:

1. **Code Splitting**: As mentioned earlier, code splitting helps in reducing the initial bundle size by loading only the necessary code for the current view, thus improving the load time.

2. **Memoization**: Use the `React.memo()` higher-order component or the `useMemo()` hook to memoize components or values that don't need to be recalculated on every render, improving rendering performance.

3. **Virtual DOM Optimization**: React's virtual DOM efficiently updates the actual DOM, but you can further optimize by minimizing the number of re-renders through techniques like shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle method, PureComponent, or using hooks like `useCallback()` to memoize event handlers.

4. **Optimized Rendering**: Use efficient rendering techniques like keys for lists, to enable React to identify which items have changed, thus reducing the number of re-renders.

5. **Bundle Size Optimization**: Minimize the size of your JavaScript bundle by using tools like Webpack or Rollup along with techniques like tree shaking, code splitting, and minimizing dependencies.

6. **Performance Profiling**: Use tools like React DevTools or browser developer tools to profile and identify performance bottlenecks. Optimize components or operations that are causing performance issues.

7. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG)**: SSR and SSG can be used to pre-render React components on the server or at build time, respectively, improving initial load times and SEO performance.

8. **State Management Optimization**: Use efficient state management libraries like Redux or React Context API and ensure that state updates are batched where possible to minimize unnecessary re-renders.

9. **Bundle Compression and Gzip**: Compress your bundle using tools like Brotli or Gzip to reduce file sizes, resulting in faster downloads.

10. **Lazy Loading and Code Splitting for Images and Assets**: Use lazy loading and code splitting techniques not only for JavaScript but also for images and other assets to defer loading until they are needed.

* when you have too muchh data you can do pagination

* also in beginnnig of you project you can use webpack.

* Code splitting in React.js refers to a technique used to optimize the performance of web applications by breaking down the JavaScript codebase into smaller chunks, and loading them only when they are needed. This helps to reduce the initial bundle size of the application, making the initial page load faster and improving the overall user experience.

In React, code splitting can be achieved using dynamic imports, also known as lazy loading. With dynamic imports, you can import components or modules asynchronously, meaning they are fetched from the server only when they are required, typically triggered by user actions such as navigating to a specific route or interacting with a particular feature.

Here's a basic example of how code splitting can be implemented in a React application using dynamic imports:

```javascript
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

const HomePage = lazy(() => import('./components/HomePage'));
const AboutPage = lazy(() => import('./components/AboutPage'));
const ContactPage = lazy(() => import('./components/ContactPage'));

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <Switch>
          <Route exact path="/" component={HomePage} />
          <Route path="/about" component={AboutPage} />
          <Route path="/contact" component={ContactPage} />
        </Switch>
      </Suspense>
    </Router>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example:

- `lazy()` function is used to asynchronously import components.
- Components are loaded only when they are accessed via their corresponding routes.
- `Suspense` component is used to specify a loading indicator while the component is being fetched.
- The `fallback` prop of `Suspense` is rendered while the component is being loaded.

By employing code splitting in React applications, you can improve performance, reduce initial load times, and provide a smoother user experience, especially for larger applications.

### Q : What is fragment in react?
A : In React, a fragment is a lightweight syntax that allows you to group multiple elements without adding an extra node to the DOM. Fragments are particularly useful when you need to return multiple elements from a component, and you don't want to introduce an additional parent node in the HTML structure.

* Fragments are a bit faster and use less memory by not creating an extra DOM node. This only has a real benefit on very large and deep trees.
* Some CSS mechanisms like Flexbox and CSS Grid have a special parent-child relationships, and adding divs in the middle makes it hard to keep the desired layout.
* The DOM Inspector is less cluttered.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello</h1>
      <p>React Fragments</p>
    </>
  );
};
```

In this example, `<>` and `</>` are shorthand syntax for a fragment. It's equivalent to using `<React.Fragment>` and `</React.Fragment>`. The elements inside the fragment are siblings and can be rendered without introducing an additional div or other container element to the DOM.

Fragments help in keeping the HTML structure clean and avoiding unnecessary nesting, which can be beneficial for styling and layout purposes. They are especially handy when you need to return multiple elements from a component function without creating an artificial parent node in the rendered output.

### Q : Explain about types of Hooks in React.
A : 
* useState(): This functional component is used to set and retrieve the state.
* useEffect(): It enables for performing the side effects in the functional components.
* useContext(): It is used for creating common data that is to be accessed by the components hierarchy without having to pass the props down to each level.
* useRef() : It will permit creating a reference to the DOM element directly within the functional component.
* useLayoutEffect(): It is used for the reading layout from the DOM and re-rendering synchronously.
* useMemo() : This will be used for recomputing the memoized value when there is a change in one of the dependencies. This optimization will help for avoiding expensive calculations on each render.
* useCallback() : This is useful while passing callbacks into the optimized child components and depends on the equality of reference for the prevention of unneeded renders.

### Q : Diff between usememo and usecallback
useMemo
useMemo is used to memoize a value (usually an object, function, or any complex computation) and to avoid recalculating it on every render unless the dependencies change.
It takes a function and an array of dependencies as arguments. The function is only re-executed when one of the dependencies has changed.
It is useful when you have a costly computation that doesn't need to be recalculated unless its dependencies change.
Example:
```
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
```
useCallback
useCallback is used to memoize a callback function to prevent unnecessary renders of components that rely on that callback.
It takes a callback function and an array of dependencies, similar to useMemo. The difference is that useCallback returns a memoized version of the callback itself.
It is useful when you want to prevent the recreation of callback functions in child components, which could cause unnecessary re-renders.
Example:
```
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  doSomethingWith(a, b);
}, [a, b]);
```
In summary, useMemo is used to memoize values, while useCallback is specifically designed for memoizing callback functions. Both are performance optimization tools, and they help in avoiding unnecessary recalculations or re-renders in React components. Use useMemo when dealing with memoizing values, and use useCallback when dealing with memoizing callback functions.

### Q : What is What is context?
A : Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

For example, authenticated users, locale preferences, UI themes need to be accessed in the application by many components.
```
const { Provider, Consumer } = React.createContext(defaultValue);
```

### Q : What would be the common mistake of function being called every time the component renders?
You need to make sure that function is not being called while passing the function as a parameter.
```
render() {
  // Wrong: handleClick is called instead of passed as a reference!
  return <button onClick={this.handleClick()}>{'Click Me'}</button>
}
```
Instead, pass the function itself without parenthesis:
```
render() {
  // Correct: handleClick is passed as a reference!
  return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>{'Click Me'}</button>
}
```

### Q : What are error boundaries in React v16?
A : Error boundaries are components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

A class component becomes an error boundary if it defines a new lifecycle method called componentDidCatch(error, info) or static getDerivedStateFromError().

### Q : How to use innerHTML in React?
A : The dangerouslySetInnerHTML attribute is React's replacement for using innerHTML in the browser DOM. Just like innerHTML, it is risky to use this attribute considering cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. You just need to pass a __html object as key and HTML text as value.

In this example MyComponent uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML attribute for setting HTML markup:
```
function createMarkup() {
  return { __html: "First &middot; Second" };
}

function MyComponent() {
  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={createMarkup()} />;
}
```

### Q : How to do error handling in react app
A : Handling errors in a React application involves implementing mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected issues, such as runtime errors, API failures, or asynchronous operations. Here are some common approaches for error handling in a React app:

1. **Using `try` and `catch` for Asynchronous Code:**
   - Wrap asynchronous code (e.g., API calls, promises) in a `try...catch` block to capture and handle errors.

    ```javascript
    async function fetchData() {
      try {
        const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
        const data = await response.json();
        // Process the data
      } catch (error) {
        // Handle errors (e.g., log, display a user-friendly message)
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error.message);
      }
    }
    ```

2. **Error Boundaries:**
   - Use React Error Boundaries to catch JavaScript errors that occur anywhere in a component tree. Error boundaries are special components that can catch errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors.

    ```javascript
    class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { hasError: false };
      }

      static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
        return { hasError: true };
      }

      componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
        // Log the error or send it to an error tracking service
        console.error('Error caught by error boundary:', error, errorInfo);
      }

      render() {
        if (this.state.hasError) {
          return <p>Something went wrong!</p>;
        }
        return this.props.children;
      }
    }
    ```

   - Wrap components or parts of the application tree with the `ErrorBoundary` component.

    ```javascript
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <MyComponent />
    </ErrorBoundary>
    ```

3. **Global Error Handling:**
   - Use `window.onerror` or `window.addEventListener('error')` to capture global errors.

    ```javascript
    window.addEventListener('error', (event) => {
      // Handle the error
      console.error('Global error:', event.error);
    });
    ```

4. **Axios Interceptors for API Calls:**
   - If using Axios for HTTP requests, utilize interceptors to handle errors globally.

    ```javascript
    axios.interceptors.response.use(
      (response) => response,
      (error) => {
        // Handle API response errors
        console.error('API error:', error.message);
        return Promise.reject(error);
      }
    );
    ```

5. **Displaying User-Friendly Messages:**
   - Present users with meaningful error messages or fallback UIs to communicate issues without revealing too much technical detail.

    ```javascript
    function MyComponent() {
      const [data, setData] = useState(null);
      const [error, setError] = useState(null);

      useEffect(() => {
        fetchData()
          .then((result) => setData(result))
          .catch((error) => setError('Error fetching data.'));
      }, []);

      if (error) {
        return <p>{error}</p>;
      }

      // Render component based on the fetched data
      return (
        <div>
          {/* Render component content */}
        </div>
      );
    }
    ```

Remember to tailor your error-handling strategy to the specific needs and characteristics of your application. Strive to provide a good user experience while also capturing relevant information for debugging during development.

## React Router

### Q : What is React Router?
A : React Router is a powerful routing library built on top of React that helps you add new screens and flows to your application incredibly quickly, all while keeping the URL in sync with what's being displayed on the page.

### Q : What are the <Router> components of React Router v4?
A : React Router v4 provides below 3 <Router> components:
*  BrowserRouter
*  HashRouter
*  MemoryRouter
The above components will create browser, hash, and memory history instances. React Router v4 makes the properties and methods of the history instance associated with your router available through the context in the router object.

### Q : What is the purpose of push() and replace() methods of history?
A : A history instance has two methods for navigation purpose.
* push()
* replace()
If you think of the history as an array of visited locations, push() will add a new location to the array and replace() will replace the current location in the array with the new one.

### Q : How to implement default or NotFound page?
A : 
```
<Switch>
  <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
  <Route path="/user" component={User} />
  <Route component={NotFound} />
</Switch>
```
-----
```
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
//import { Route } from "react-router";
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";

import Login from "./Login";
import Register from "./Register";
import Dashboard from "./Dashboard";
import "./Login.css";

ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Login />} />
      <Route path="/register" element={<Register />} />
      <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
    </Routes>
  </BrowserRouter>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

## React Redux

### Q : What is flux
A : Flux is an architectural pattern developed by Facebook for managing state in web applications, particularly in conjunction with React. It introduces a unidirectional data flow, involving actions, a dispatcher, stores, and views (React components), to provide a structured and scalable approach to state management. The goal is to make it easier to handle complex state logic and maintainable user interfaces in large applications. While Flux itself is not a library or framework, it has influenced the design of state management libraries such as Redux.

### Q : What is Redux?
A : Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps based on the Flux design pattern. Redux can be used together with React, or with any other view library. It is tiny (about 2kB) and has no dependencies.

* Action Creator ====>     Action    ====> Dispatch Action ====>     Reducer    ====> Central store
Compare to ticket booking below
*      You       ====> Booking Form  ====>  Submit Foram   ====> Ticket Counter ====> Railway Central Store

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, commonly used with React for managing the state of applications in a more organized and scalable way. It follows the principles of the Flux architecture but introduces some key concepts and patterns that simplify state management.

### Key Concepts in Redux:

1. **Store:** The store is a single source of truth for the state of the entire application. It holds the current state tree and allows access to it. State in a Redux store is read-only, and any changes are made by dispatching actions.

2. **Actions:** Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe an event or change in the application. They are the only way to modify the state in a Redux application. Actions must have a `type` property indicating the type of action being performed.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   {
     type: 'INCREMENT',
     payload: 1
   }
   ```

3. **Reducers:** Reducers are pure functions that specify how the state changes in response to an action. They take the current state and an action as arguments and return the next state. Reducers should not have side effects and should not modify the existing state; they create and return a new state.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
     switch (action.type) {
       case 'INCREMENT':
         return state + action.payload;
       default:
         return state;
     }
   };
   ```

4. **Dispatch:** The `dispatch` function is used to dispatch actions to the Redux store. When an action is dispatched, it triggers the execution of reducers, leading to a change in the state.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT', payload: 1 });
   ```

5. **Selectors:** Selectors are functions used to extract specific pieces of data from the state. They help in accessing and deriving data from the store without directly interacting with its structure.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const getCounterValue = state => state.counter;
   ```

### Example Redux Setup:

```javascript
// store.js
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers'; // Combined reducers

const store = createStore(rootReducer);

export default store;
```

```javascript
// actions.js
export const increment = (amount) => ({
  type: 'INCREMENT',
  payload: amount
});
```

```javascript
// reducers.js
const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state + action.payload;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

// Combine reducers if needed
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  counter: counterReducer,
  // other reducers...
});

export default rootReducer;
```

```javascript
// Component using Redux
import React from 'react';
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { increment } from './actions';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const counter = useSelector(state => state.counter);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  const handleIncrement = () => {
    dispatch(increment(1));
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Counter: {counter}</p>
      <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example, Redux is set up with a store, actions, reducers, and a React component that uses the `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks to interact with the Redux store. The state of the application is centralized in the Redux store, and changes are made through dispatched actions.

### Q : What is middleware in redux?
A : Let's create a simple middleware that logs each action dispatched in Redux along with the current state before and after the action is processed by the reducers. This will help us understand how middleware works in Redux.

Here's the middleware:

```javascript
const loggingMiddleware = store => next => action => {
  // Log the current state before the action is processed
  console.log('Current State:', store.getState());

  // Log the action being dispatched
  console.log('Dispatching Action:', action);

  // Call the next middleware in the chain or the dispatch function if this is the last middleware
  const result = next(action);

  // Log the new state after the action is processed by the reducers
  console.log('New State:', store.getState());

  // Return the result of calling the next middleware or the dispatch function
  return result;
};
```

Now, let's apply this middleware when creating the Redux store:

```javascript
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers'; // Assuming you have a root reducer

const store = createStore(
  rootReducer, // Your root reducer
  applyMiddleware(loggingMiddleware) // Apply loggingMiddleware
);
```

Here's what the middleware does:

1. It receives the `store` as an argument in its outer function, which represents the Redux store.
2. It returns another function that receives `next` as an argument. `next` is a reference to the next middleware in the chain or the dispatch function if there's no middleware left.
3. Inside the innermost function, it receives `action`, which is the action being dispatched.
4. It logs the current state before the action is processed.
5. It logs the action being dispatched.
6. It calls the `next` function with the `action`, which either passes the action to the next middleware or to the reducers.
7. After the action is processed by the reducers, it logs the new state.
8. It returns the result of calling the `next` function.

By applying this middleware, every action dispatched in your Redux application will be logged to the console along with the current and new state. This helps in debugging and understanding how actions affect the application state.

### Q : What are the core principles of Redux?
A : Redux follows three fundamental principles:

* Single source of truth: The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store. The single state tree makes it easier to keep track of changes over time and debug or inspect the application.

* State is read-only: The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened. This ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks will ever write directly to the state.

* Changes are made with pure functions: To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write reducers. Reducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action as parameters, and return the next state.

### Q : How to access Redux store outside a component?
A : You just need to export the store from the module where it created with createStore(). Also, it shouldn't pollute the global window object.
```
store = createStore(myReducer);
export default store;
```

### Q : What is the difference between React context and React Redux?
A : You can use Context in your application directly and is going to be great for passing down data to deeply nested components which what it was designed for.React Context is a React feature for sharing data across components in a component tree. It's flexible and suitable for scenarios where prop drilling becomes inconvenient.

Whereas Redux is much more powerful and provides a large number of features that the Context API doesn't provide. Also, React Redux uses context internally but it doesn't expose this fact in the public API. React Redux is a state management library specifically designed for managing complex state logic in React applications, following the Flux architecture principles. It provides a predictable and centralized way to handle application state.

### Q : What are Redux selectors and why to use them?
A : Selectors are functions that take Redux state as an argument and return some data to pass to the component.

For example, to get user details from the state:
```
const getUserData = (state) => state.user.data;
```
These selectors have two main benefits,

The selector can compute derived data, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state
The selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments changes


## simple ToDO with react class component
```
import React, { Component } from "react";

class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { todos: [], task: "" };
  }

  onChangeTask = (e) => {
    this.setState({
      task: e.target.value
    });
  };

  addTask = () => {
    let { todos, task } = this.state;
    todos.push(task);
    this.setState(
      {
        todos: todos,
        task: ""
      },
      () => {
        console.log(this.state);
      }
    );
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <div className="App">
          <h1>Todo</h1>
          <input
            type="text"
            value={this.state.task}
            onChange={(e) => {
              this.onChangeTask(e);
            }}
          />
          <button onClick={this.addTask} disabled={!this.state.task}>
            Add
          </button>
        </div>
        <ul>
          {this.state.todos.length > 0 && this.state.todos.map((todo, index) => (
            <li key={index}>{todo}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

## todo with functional components
```
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";

// Functional component
const TodoDisplay = (props) => {
  return <li>{props.todo}</li>;
};

// Main App component
// renders a list of Messages using data from messages.json
const App = () => {
  const [task, setTask] = useState("");
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);
  const addTask = () => {
    todos.push(task);
    setTodos(todos);
    setTask("");
  };

  return (
    <>
      <h2>To Do</h2>
      <div>
        <input value={task} onChange={(e) => setTask(e.target.value)} />

render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

## Server Side rendering VS. Client Side Rendering
Here's a simplified comparison between Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Client-Side Rendering (CSR):

| Feature                | Server-Side Rendering (SSR)                  | Client-Side Rendering (CSR)              |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Where rendering happens| Rendering happens on the server.             | Rendering happens in the browser.        |
| Initial load           | Initial page loads faster.                   | Initial page load might be slower.       |
| Search engine indexing | Better for SEO.                              | Can be challenging for SEO.              |
| Server load            | Higher server load as it generates HTML.     | Lower server load, as it serves files.   |
| Development            | Can be more complex, especially for large apps.| Often simpler, focusing on client-side logic. |

In simple terms, with Server-Side Rendering, the server prepares the webpage before sending it to the user's browser, making the initial load faster and better for search engines. Client-Side Rendering, on the other hand, sends a basic webpage to the browser, which then uses JavaScript to load and display content, potentially making the initial load slower, but offering more dynamic and interactive experiences once loaded.

# in React
In React, both Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Client-Side Rendering (CSR) are possible. React provides the flexibility to implement either approach based on your project requirements.

### Server-Side Rendering (SSR) in React:

1. **Setup**:
   - Set up a server environment (e.g., Node.js) to render React components on the server.
   - Use libraries like `ReactDOMServer` to render React components to HTML strings on the server.

2. **Routing**:
   - Configure server-side routing to handle incoming requests and render the appropriate React components based on the requested URL.

3. **Data Fetching**:
   - Fetch data from APIs or databases on the server before rendering React components.
   - Pass fetched data as props to React components during rendering.

4. **Rendering**:
   - Render the React components to HTML strings on the server using `ReactDOMServer.renderToString()` or `ReactDOMServer.renderToNodeStream()`.

5. **Client Hydration**:
   - Send the pre-rendered HTML to the client's browser as the initial response.
   - Rehydrate the React components on the client side using `ReactDOM.hydrate()` to attach event listeners and enable client-side interactivity.

### Client-Side Rendering (CSR) in React:

1. **Setup**:
   - Set up a client-side development environment with React to build interactive web applications.
   - Serve a minimal HTML page containing references to JavaScript and CSS files.

2. **Routing**:
   - Implement client-side routing using libraries like React Router to manage navigation and rendering of React components based on the URL.

3. **Data Fetching**:
   - Fetch data from APIs or databases asynchronously using methods like `fetch()` or libraries like Axios.
   - Update component state or Redux store with the fetched data, triggering re-renders as needed.

4. **Rendering**:
   - Render React components in the browser using JavaScript.
   - Updates to the DOM are handled by React's virtual DOM and reconciled efficiently with the actual DOM.

5. **Interactivity**:
   - Handle user interactions and state changes within React components using event handlers and component lifecycle methods.

### Hybrid Approaches:

React also supports hybrid rendering approaches, where you can combine SSR and CSR based on specific routes or components within your application. Frameworks like Next.js provide built-in support for hybrid rendering, simplifying the implementation process and offering benefits of both SSR and CSR as needed.
